1. Create a new express server that has a route for creating

# Discord users, and a route for getting Discord user's by name.

The discord user should have a

# name,

# isAdmin,

# roles,

# createdAt

where createdAt is the current timestamp when the user is created. The user should be stored into a users array.

The .get route should look in that user array for the provided name.

2. Do the same for discord messages, and a route to edit discord message texts.
   So, a post route to create a discord message, and you pass in data to it like: {message: "hello", user: "Horseman", keks: 0}. Then create a new discord message, push it to a messages array, and return it with res.send. give each discord message a unique ID as well, it can just be a number, incrementing from 0.

Then, a route to get discord messages by username. Pass in a username, and look through the messages array to find all messages from that user and return them.

Then, a new ".put" route (different from get or post, put is for editing existing records). It should accept an ID of a message in the route name, "/message/:I'd The route should find the message by ID in the messages array, and update the text to the new text. It should accept data like {newMessage: "newMessage here"}
